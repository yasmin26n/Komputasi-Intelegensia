Try modifying the network architecture and resolution conversion, e.g., to 56 or to 84 dimensions for its input instead. Can you do so without reducing the accuracy of the network? Consult the VGG paper (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014) for ideas on adding more nonlinearities prior to downsampling."

        "Probability Integral Transform (PIT) adalah metode yang mengubah distribusi data menjadi distribusi uniform melalui fungsi distribusi kumulatif (CDF). Menerapkan PIT dalam konteks normalisasi di jaringan saraf dapat memberikan beberapa keuntungan:\n",
        "- Dengan mengubah data menjadi distribusi uniform, model dapat lebih mudah mempelajari pola, yang dapat meningkatkan kecepatan konvergensi.\n",
        "- Menggunakan PIT dapat membantu menormalkan data secara lebih efektif, sehingga mengurangi risiko overfitting pada data pelatihan.\n",
        "- PIT dapat membantu dalam stabilisasi pelatihan, terutama dalam situasi di mana data memiliki distribusi yang tidak normal.\n",

        "- Ketika jumlah fitur mendekati atau melebihi jumlah sampel, matriks kovarians penuh-rank dapat menyesuaikan diri dengan noise dalam data daripada distribusi yang mendasarinya. Hal ini dapat menyebabkan overfitting, di mana model berkinerja baik pada data pelatihan tetapi buruk pada data yang tidak terlihat.\n",
        "- Matriks kovarians penuh-rank dapat menjadi mahal untuk dihitung dan dibalik, terutama saat dimensi meningkat. Ini dapat mengakibatkan waktu pelatihan yang lebih lambat dan penggunaan memori yang lebih tinggi.\n",
        "- Dalam ruang berdimensi tinggi, matriks kovarians dapat menjadi tidak terdefinisi dengan baik (ill-conditioned), sehingga sulit untuk secara akurat menghitung inversnya. Ini dapat menyebabkan ketidakstabilan numerik dalam perhitungan selanjutnya.\n",

Teknik-teknik ini dapat membantu menangkap fitur yang paling relevan sambil mengurangi masalah yang terkait dengan estimasi penuh-rank."

Pemilihan antara average pooling dan max-pooling dalam lapisan transisi bergantung pada tujuan desain dan sifat yang diinginkan dari jaringan.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dalam DenseNet, average pooling sering dipilih karena beberapa alasan berikut:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Retensi Fitur**: Average pooling menghitung nilai rata-rata dari elemen dalam suatu wilayah pooling, sehingga mempertahankan lebih banyak informasi dibandingkan max-pooling yang hanya memilih nilai maksimum. Hal ini membantu dalam menjaga representasi fitur yang lebih komprehensif.\n",

        "2. **Efek Perataan**: Average pooling memberikan efek perataan pada peta fitur output, yang dapat mengurangi risiko overfitting dengan mencegah jaringan terlalu sensitif terhadap detail tertentu dalam data.\n",

        "3. **Stabilitas**: Average pooling kurang sensitif terhadap outlier dibandingkan dengan max-pooling, membuat jaringan lebih robust terhadap noise atau variasi dalam data input.\n",

        "4. **Invarian Translasi**: Average pooling memberikan tingkat invarian translasi tertentu dengan mempertimbangkan distribusi nilai secara keseluruhan dalam wilayah pooling. Ini berguna ketika pergeseran kecil pada input tidak seharusnya mempengaruhi output secara signifikan.\n",

        "5. **Berbagi Informasi**: Average pooling mendorong berbagi informasi di antara piksel atau unit tetangga, membantu menangkap pola dan struktur global yang ada dalam data input."

        "- Pemilihan Fungsi Aktivasi: Gunakan fungsi aktivasi yang sesuai (seperti ReLU atau Leaky ReLU) untuk mempercepat pembelajaran.\n",
        "- Penggunaan Sparsitas: Pertimbangkan sparsitas untuk mengurangi kompleksitas model dan meningkatkan efisiensi.\n",
        "- Transfer Pembelajaran: Manfaatkan pembelajaran transfer dari model kecil ke model besar, yaitu dengan menerapkan pengetahuan yang diperoleh dari model kecil ke dalam model yang lebih besar.\n"
